## üéØ **Decision-Making Framework**

Every architectural decision in the infrastructure transformation follows a systematic evaluation process:

1. **Problem Definition**: What specific issue are we solving?
2. **Options Analysis**: What alternatives are available?
3. **Trade-off Evaluation**: What are the costs and benefits?
4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong?
5. **Future Proofing**: How does this scale and evolve?

This document captures the major architectural decisions and their rationale.

# Lessons Learned: From LXC to Kubernetes

**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Author**: Christian Groover  
**Context**: Infrastructure transformation retrospective and decision analysis  

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

After 18 months of operating a sophisticated LXC-based homelab with enterprise-grade automation, I'm embarking on a complete architectural transformation to Kubernetes. This retrospective examines what worked, what didn't, and the hard-learned lessons that inform the next-generation platform design.

**Key Insight**: Sometimes the best infrastructure is the one you outgrow‚Äîit means you've learned enough to build something better.

## ‚úÖ **What Worked Exceptionally Well**

### **1. Service User Security Model**

**Implementation**: Every LXC container had a dedicated service user (gitlab, postgresql, authelia, etc.) with passwordless sudo and SSH key access.

**Why It Worked**:
- Eliminated root access patterns completely
- Provided clear audit trails
- Enabled fine-grained automation access
- Simplified troubleshooting and maintenance

**Carrying Forward**: This security model will be enhanced in Kubernetes with proper RBAC and service accounts.

### **2. Snapshot-Driven Deployment Methodology**

**Implementation**: Created Proxmox snapshots at every major state transition:
- `initial-setup`: Fresh container after creation
- `clean-base`: Service user configured
- `service-installed`: Software installed but not configured
- `service-configured`: Fully operational

**Why It Worked**:
- Instant rollback capability (30 seconds to working state)
- Eliminated fear of experimentation
- Perfect for iterative configuration development
- Saved countless hours during failed deployments

**Carrying Forward**: Kubernetes doesn't have snapshot equivalent, but Helm releases and GitOps provide similar rollback capabilities.

### **3. Enterprise Security Integration (1Password CLI)**

**Implementation**: Eliminated all hardcoded credentials through automated 1Password integration.

**Impact**:
- 100% credential security compliance
- Repositories safe for public showcase
- Enterprise-grade audit trails
- Foundation for automated secret rotation

**Carrying Forward**: Sealed Secrets with 1Password will provide similar security in Kubernetes with better scalability.

### **4. GitLab CE as Automation Hub**

**Implementation**: Self-hosted GitLab with comprehensive CI/CD pipelines.

**Achievements**:
- Deployed in under 1 hour
- Complete SSH mesh integration
- Enterprise features without licensing costs
- Ready for team collaboration

**Carrying Forward**: GitLab Helm chart deployment will provide same functionality with better resource utilization.

## ‚ùå **What Didn't Work: Hard Lessons Learned**

### **1. Terraform Proxmox Provider Reliability**

**The Problem**: 
- Inconsistent container provisioning
- State file corruption during complex operations
- Provider-specific bugs causing deployment failures
- More time spent debugging tooling than delivering value

**Failed Attempts**:
- Multiple provider versions
- Different state backends
- Alternative community providers
- Complex retry logic and error handling

**Lesson Learned**: Use the right tool for the right job. Terraform excels at complex orchestration (Kubernetes clusters), but manual provisioning with proper documentation often wins for simple containers.

**New Approach**: Terraform for K3s VM provisioning (appropriate use case), Kubernetes native tools for workload management.

### **2. Network Architecture Complexity**

**The Problem**:
- VyOS required dedicated VM resources
- Complex configuration management with VyOS-specific syntax
- Multiple routing hops reducing performance
- Difficult integration with Proxmox native features
- Manual firewall rule synchronization

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Ansible automation for VyOS configuration
- Configuration version control
- Automated backup and restore procedures

**Why It Failed**: The abstraction provided by VyOS didn't justify the operational complexity for a homelab environment.

**Lesson Learned**: Native solutions often provide better integration and lower total cost of ownership.

**New Approach**: Proxmox SDN with FRRouting provides enterprise-grade networking with API-driven automation and better resource utilization.

### **3. Documentation Fragmentation**

**The Problem**:
- 41+ documentation files across multiple directories
- Knowledge scattered without central coherence
- Version control challenges across documents
- Difficult to maintain consistency
- Nearly impossible for others to understand the system

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Documentation templates and standards
- Regular documentation review cycles
- Cross-referencing between documents

**Why It Failed**: Distributed documentation requires distributed maintenance, which doesn't scale.

**Lesson Learned**: Centralized, authoritative documentation with workflow-driven operations reduces cognitive load and maintenance burden.

**New Approach**: AI-powered documentation platform will aggregate knowledge from multiple sources and provide intelligent search and assistance.

### **4. Resource Inefficiency**

**The Problem**:
- Over-provisioned containers with poor utilization
- No dynamic resource allocation
- Difficult capacity planning
- Wasteful resource distribution

**Example**: 9 containers with 4GB RAM each = 36GB allocated, but peak usage rarely exceeded 20GB total.

**Lesson Learned**: Static resource allocation works for small deployments but doesn't scale efficiently.

**New Approach**: Kubernetes resource requests/limits with horizontal pod autoscaling will optimize resource utilization.

## üí° **What I'd Do Differently**

### **If Starting the LXC Journey Again**

1. **Start with resource monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one to understand actual resource needs
2. **Design for automation from the beginning**: Don't bolt on automation later‚Äîbuild it into the foundation
3. **Prioritize network simplicity**: Use Proxmox SDN from the start instead of adding VyOS complexity
4. **Document decisions, not just procedures**: Capture why decisions were made, not just how things work
5. **Plan for team collaboration**: Build systems others could understand and maintain

### **If Choosing Technologies Again**

1. **Terraform**: Only for complex orchestration (K8s clusters, multi-cloud), not simple resource provisioning
2. **Networking**: Start with native solutions, add complexity only when necessary
3. **Documentation**: Single source of truth with automated generation where possible
4. **Security**: Implement proper credential management before public repositories
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability from day one, not as an afterthought

## üéØ **Key Takeaways for Fellow Engineers**

### **1. Embrace Planned Obsolescence**
Build infrastructure you plan to outgrow. The goal isn't to build the perfect system‚Äîit's to build the system that teaches you how to build the perfect system.

### **2. Operational Complexity is Technical Debt**
Every custom solution, every manual process, every undocumented decision creates debt that must be paid with time and frustration later.

### **3. Right Tool for Right Job**
Popular tools aren't always the right tools. Terraform is excellent for complex orchestration but overkill for simple provisioning. Choose based on problem fit, not popularity.

### **4. Security is Foundational, Not Additive**
Implementing proper credential management early saves enormous time later. Security practices that feel burdensome become protective advantages.

### **5. Document Decisions, Not Just Procedures**
Future you (and your team) need to understand why decisions were made, not just how to execute procedures.

## üöÄ **Looking Forward: The Next Architecture**

### **What I'm Excited About**

1. **AI-Powered Operations**: Custom LLM trained on infrastructure documentation providing intelligent assistance
2. **True Self-Healing**: Prometheus metrics feeding AI decision-making for automated remediation
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Dynamic allocation based on actual usage patterns
4. **Enterprise Networking**: EVPN-VXLAN providing data center-grade capabilities
5. **Team Readiness**: Architecture designed for collaboration from day one

### **What I'm Nervous About**

1. **Single-Node Risk**: K3s on single VM vs. distributed LXC containers
2. **Complexity Management**: More sophisticated technology requiring deeper expertise
3. **AI Reliability**: Custom LLM making infrastructure decisions autonomously
4. **Migration Risk**: Moving from stable, working system to unproven architecture

### **Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Comprehensive Backup**: Snapshots, external database preservation, documented rollback
2. **Gradual Migration**: Parallel deployment with traffic shifting, not big-bang cutover
3. **AI Guardrails**: Human approval gates for critical decisions, confidence thresholds
4. **Extensive Testing**: Proof-of-concept validation before production migration

## üéì **Advice for Self-Taught Engineers**

### **1. Build to Learn, Not to Last**
Your homelab isn't production infrastructure‚Äîit's a learning laboratory. Build systems you can break, rebuild, and improve.

### **2. Document Your Journey**
Your failures teach others more than your successes. Share what didn't work and why.

### **3. Embrace the Rebuild**
Don't be afraid to throw away working systems if you've learned enough to build better ones.

### **4. Focus on Fundamentals**
Networking, security, and automation principles transfer across technologies. Master the concepts, not just the tools.

### **5. Plan for Collaboration**
Build systems as if you'll need to hand them off to someone else tomorrow. This forces clarity in design and documentation.

**The best infrastructure isn't the one that never breaks‚Äîit's the one that teaches you how to build unbreakable systems.** üöÄ

Every failure in the LXC architecture has informed a solution in the Kubernetes design. That's not just technical improvement‚Äîit's engineering maturity.
